# Currency Overlay Simulation Engine

## üéØ What I Built

I developed this **Currency Overlay Simulation Engine** because I was curious about how different FX hedging strategies actually perform in practice. After reading about massive currency losses at various funds, I wanted to build something that could simulate and compare hedging approaches with real quantitative rigor.

**Why This Matters**: I've always been fascinated by the $6+ trillion daily FX market and how a simple currency move can make or break a global portfolio. This simulation lets me explore different hedging strategies, stress test them against extreme scenarios, and see which approaches actually work when markets get volatile.

## üöÄ What It Does

### **üìà Realistic FX Data Simulation**
- I generate **180 days of synthetic FX data** using geometric Brownian motion - basically modeling how currencies actually move
- **Five major currencies**: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and an EM basket (because that's where things get interesting)
- Each currency has its own **volatility and drift patterns** based on real market characteristics

### **üè¶ Multi-Currency Portfolio Testing**
- Built a **$100M test portfolio** with realistic global exposure (like what you'd see at a real fund)
- **Smart allocation**: 45% USD, 25% EUR, 10% GBP, 12% JPY, 8% EM - mirrors typical institutional portfolios
- Factors in both **local asset performance** and **currency translation effects**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Hedging Strategy Comparison**
- Tests **three approaches**: No hedging (risky), 50% hedged (balanced), 100% hedged (conservative)
- **Includes hedging costs** because free lunches don't exist in finance
- Shows you exactly how each strategy performs under different market conditions

### **üìä Smart Volatility Forecasting**
- **ARIMA-GARCH models** that actually predict future volatility (not just historical averages)
- **30-day forward projections** so you can see what's coming
- **Volatility clustering detection** - because market stress tends to cluster

### **üö® Stress Testing That Actually Stresses**
- **12 different crisis scenarios** - individual currency crashes, correlated meltdowns, you name it
- **Extreme moves**: ¬±15% shocks, EM crises, broad dollar collapses
- Shows you exactly how well (or poorly) your hedging works when it really matters

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Proper Risk Measurement**
- **VaR and CVaR calculations** at 95% and 99% confidence (the metrics that actually matter)
- **Three different methods**: Historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo (because I wanted to be thorough)
- **All the key metrics**: Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, hit rates - everything you need to evaluate performance

## üìä The Charts That Tell the Story

I built **8 main visualizations** because the data is useless without good charts:

1. **FX Rates Evolution** - See how each currency moved over the 180 days
2. **Portfolio Value Evolution** - Compare how different hedging strategies actually performed
3. **Daily Returns Distribution** - Visualize the risk you're really taking with each approach
4. **Rolling Volatility Analysis** - Watch volatility change over time (spoiler: it clusters)
5. **Value at Risk Comparison** - See your maximum expected losses side by side
6. **Risk-Return Profile** - The classic risk vs return scatter plot that actually matters
7. **Currency Contribution Analysis** - Find out which currencies are helping vs hurting
8. **Drawdown Analysis** - See your worst losing streaks and how long they lasted

**Plus some bonus charts**:
- **Volatility forecasts by currency** - historical vs what the models predict
- **Stress test visualizations** - see exactly how bad things can get

## üí° What I Learned

### **üéØ The Surprising Results**

**The 50% hedge is the sweet spot**:
- **Partial hedging (50%)** consistently gave the best risk-adjusted returns - not too conservative, not too risky
- **Full hedging (100%)** was way too conservative - you eliminate risk but also eliminate most of your upside
- **No hedging** was a roller coaster - great when it worked, brutal when it didn't

**Hedging actually works when you need it most**:
- The **50% strategy cut risk by 70%+** during stress scenarios while still letting you participate in good times
- **VaR dropped by 40-60%** with systematic hedging - that's real risk reduction
- **Volatility forecasting** was surprisingly useful - you can actually see trouble coming if you look for the right signals

### **üöÄ If I Were Building This for Real**

**Week 1-2: Get the basics working**
- Set up real-time FX feeds (no more synthetic data)
- Build the VaR calculations into a daily system

**Week 3-4: Add the smart stuff**
- Code up dynamic hedge adjustments that actually respond to market changes
- Build the stress testing into a regular process

**Week 5-6: Make it predictive**
- Deploy the GARCH models for real volatility forecasting
- Add market regime detection so the system adapts automatically

**Ongoing: Keep it honest**
- Daily risk reports with real alerts
- Monthly reviews to see what's working and what isn't

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run It

### **What You'll Need**
- **Python 3.8+** (I built this on 3.9)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or JupyterLab if you're fancy)

### **Install the Libraries**
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels arch
```

### **What Each Library Does**
- `numpy` & `pandas` - The workhorses for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Make the charts actually look good
- `scipy` - Statistical functions and optimization
- `statsmodels` - ARIMA time series modeling
- `arch` - GARCH volatility modeling (this one's specialized for finance)

### **Getting It Running**
1. **Grab the code**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd fx-overlay-optimization-engine
   ```

2. **Install everything**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Fire up Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fx-overlay-optimization-engine.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the cells from top to bottom** - I built it to work sequentially, so don't skip around

### **Want to Customize It?**
- **Change the time period**: Tweak `SIMULATION_DAYS` 
- **Adjust portfolio weights**: Modify the `portfolio_weights` dictionary
- **Play with currency assumptions**: Update the volatility/drift in `currency_params`
- **Add your own stress tests**: Extend the stress scenarios section with whatever crisis you want to model

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Fine Print

**This is all synthetic data** - I built this for learning and experimentation, not for making actual investment decisions.

- **Don't bet the farm on this**: It's a simulation with fake data, not a crystal ball
- **Models have limits**: GARCH and ARIMA are good but they're not magic - they can miss black swan events
- **Real trading is messier**: Actual implementation needs real data, regulatory compliance, and proper risk controls
- **Test before you trust**: If you want to use any of these ideas for real, backtest with actual historical data first

## üéØ What This Shows About My Skills

Building this simulation let me dive deep into:

- **Quantitative Finance**: GARCH/ARIMA modeling, VaR calculations, portfolio optimization
- **Python for Finance**: Using specialized libraries like `arch` and `statsmodels` for real financial modeling
- **Risk Management**: Building comprehensive stress testing and risk measurement frameworks
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts that actually communicate insights clearly
- **Strategic Thinking**: Translating complex quantitative results into actionable insights

**The Bottom Line**: I can build sophisticated financial models, but more importantly, I can explain what they mean and why they matter.

## üöÄ Next Steps
